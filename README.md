# graphic-editor-simulator

Graphical editors allow users to edit images in the same way text editors let us modify documents.

Images are represented as an M x N array of pixels with each pixel given colour.

Produce a program that simulates a simple interactive graphical editor.

## Input

The input consists of a line containing a sequence of commands. Each command is represented by a single capital letter at the start of the line. Arguments to the command are separated by spaces and follow the command character.

Pixel co-ordinates are represented by a pair of integers: 1) a column number between 1 and M, and 2) a row number between 1 and N. Where 1 <= M, N <= 250. The origin sits in the upper-left of the table. Colours are specified by capital letters.

### Commands
The editor supports 8 commands:
1. **(I M N)**. Create a new M x N image with all pixels coloured white (O).
2. **(C)**. Clears the table, setting all pixels to white (O).
3. **(L X Y C)**. Colours the pixel (X,Y) with colour C.
4. **(V X Y1 Y2 C)**. Draw a vertical segment of colour C in column X between rows Y1 and Y2
(inclusive).
5. **(H X1 X2 Y C)** . Draw a horizontal segment of colour C in row Y between columns X1 and X2
(inclusive).
6. **(F X Y C)** . Fill the region R with the colour C. R is defined as: Pixel (X,Y) belongs to R. Any other
pixel which is the same colour as (X,Y) and shares a common side with any pixel in R also
belongs to this region.
7. **(S)** . Show the contents of the current image
8. **(X)** . Terminate the session

## Usage

### Standalone

Using the terminal, change into the project root directory and run `lein uberjar` to compile the jar file.

Then run `java -jar target\uberjar\graphic-editor-simulator-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` to start the standalone REPL.

Then simply enter the commands. E.g.:

```
=> I 5 6 ;; Creates a 5 x 6 image
=> S ;; Shows the contents in the current image
=> C ;; Sets all the point values in the current image to "O"
=> L 2 3 A ;; Updates the value in the second column on the third row to "A"
=> F 3 3 J ;; Updates the value of all vertical/horizontal neighbouring points that recursively join the initial column 3 in row 3 and have the same initial value
=> V 2 3 4 W ;; Updates the values in the second column on rows 3 and 4 to "W"
=> H 3 4 2 Z ;; Updates the values in columns 3 and 4 on row 2 to "Z"
=> X ;; Terminates the session, exiting the REPL
```

### Leiningen

Using the terminal, change into the project root directory and run `lein repl`.

Once the REPL is running, execute the various commands. E.g.:

```
=> (I 5 6) ;; Creates a 5 x 6 image
=> (S) ;; Shows the contents in the current image
=> (C) ;; Sets all the point values in the current image to "O"
=> (L 2 3 "A") ;; Updates the value in the second column on the third row to "A"
=> (F 3 3 "J") ;; Updates the value of all vertical/horizontal neighbouring points that recursively join the initial column 3 in row 3 and have the same initial value
=> (V 2 3 4 "W") ;; Updates the values in the second column on rows 3 and 4 to "W"
=> (H 3 4 2 "Z") ;; Updates the values in columns 3 and 4 on row 2 to "Z"
```

### Tests

Using the terminal, change into the project root directory and run `lein test`.

Note: Tests are not complete.

## Bugs

The `F` function needs some refactoring to improve it's efficiency (maybe a recursive helper function with an argument that is the set of processed pixels which returns an updated set). It fails within the `lein repl` execution at about `I 69 69` boundary.

There is also a bug within the save function when being called from the `-main` function in the standalone execution. Only seems to be updating the initial pixel point and not any subsequent points that appear to work correctly in the `lein repl` execution.
